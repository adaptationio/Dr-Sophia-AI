# üîß Outlook HTML Signature Fix - Showing as Code Issue

**Problem:** HTML code shows as text instead of rendering as signature
**Solution:** Use browser method to copy formatted content

---

## üîç What's Happening

**The Issue:**
- You copied HTML code from Notepad
- Pasted into Outlook signature editor
- Outlook shows the HTML code as plain text
- Signature displays as code, not formatted

**Why This Happens:**
- Outlook's signature editor expects **FORMATTED content**, not raw HTML code
- When you paste HTML code directly, Outlook treats it as text
- You need to paste the **RENDERED** version, not the code
