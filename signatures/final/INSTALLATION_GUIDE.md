## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Images Not Loading

**Symptom:** Broken image icons instead of banner/icons
**Cause:** Internet connection or image hosting issue

**Solution:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Test image URL in browser: https://adaptationio.github.io/Dr-Sophia-AI/assets/images/banners/dr-sophia-banner-rectangle.png
3. If URL works in browser but not in email, wait a few minutes and try again
4. Some email clients block external images by default - recipients may need to "Show images"

### Issue: Formatting Looks Wrong

**Symptom:** Text not aligned, colors missing, layout broken

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you copied the ENTIRE HTML code
2. Try copying and pasting again
3. In Outlook Desktop, use Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V (don't use mouse selection)
4. Close and reopen Outlook

### Issue: Signature Not Appearing

**Symptom:** New emails don't have signature

**Solution:**
1. Check that you set it as default in signature settings
2. Try manually inserting: **Insert** → **Signature** → Select your signature
3. Restart Outlook

### Issue: Links Not Clickable

**Symptom:** Can't click phone/email/LinkedIn

**Solution:**
1. This is normal in the signature editor
2. Links will work in actual sent emails
3. Test by sending yourself an email

### Issue: Banner Too Large on Mobile

**Symptom:** Signature too wide on phone screen

**Solution:**
1. This is expected - signature is optimized for desktop
2. Consider using text-only signature on mobile (see Mobile Setup section)
3. Banner will auto-resize due to max-width: 100% CSS
