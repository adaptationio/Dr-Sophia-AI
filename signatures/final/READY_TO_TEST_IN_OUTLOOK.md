**2. Wait for Images:**
- After pasting, wait 5-10 seconds

## 🚨 If Still Too Large

**Try these:**

**Option 1:** Use Outlook Web App
- Go to outlook.office.com
- Settings → Mail → Compose and reply
- Paste signature there
- Sometimes works better

**Option 2:** Smaller size
- I can change to width="450" or width="400"
- Quick adjustment
- Let me know if needed

**Option 3:** Manual resize in Outlook
- After pasting, click banner image
- Drag corner to resize
- Outlook should preserve size
